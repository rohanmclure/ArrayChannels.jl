In this article we presented the \texttt{ArrayChannels.jl} library, providing in-place communication for array data to the Julia language. The library supports a number of parallelism patterns, such as point-to-point communication, parallel reduction and the scatter / gather pattern. We evaluated the performance of both \texttt{ArrayChannels.jl} and \texttt{Distributed.jl} on a number of benchmarks to demonstrate how improved temporal locality can significantly improve the performance scalability of numerical codes.

Our evaluation revealed that while tasks involving large, overlapping communication events may still favour the eager communication model in `Distributed.jl`, however many realistic computation efforts perform better when messages are transferred in-place. By using `ArrayChannels.jl` constructs improved total throughput obtainable by message passing by up to 150\%, and on realistic benchmarks with up to 71\% for the stencil kernel and up to 152\% improvement on vector reduction.
